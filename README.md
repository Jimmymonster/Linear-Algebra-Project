# Linear-Algebra-Project
## About this project
This project use bruteforce to solve traveling salesman problem to find the path. Then use that path to calculate and compare the best path you should go. The algorithm is O(n!) if the case is complete graph also you can't travel back to visited node. (Maybe I could use all pair shortest path algorithm to make this problem can travel back to visited node!!!)
